This is the code for a Bachelor's of Physics and Astronomy project done on the University of Southampton 

It was used to detect a pulsar, then to discover its period/frequency and analyse the light curve. Discovering it is the PSR J1748-2021B pulsar in the NGC 6440 globular cluster

Most code is applicable to any data with varying parameters, and may be used to search for pulsars
